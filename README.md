# Comments
`When I was really young Lego really interested me, more of the constructing the manual, then deconstructing it to make an imaginary set.`

`So then when I first played a videogame I really wanted to know how to make it and I just imagined all the effort that was taken to make it.`

`4 years after that I started to code basic things like number + number.`

`Then I got into website development, after that I got interested with C++, and then game development.`

`I do not just focus on one language or project I think of the languages as tools some are good for some things and some others are good for other things.`

`Unluckily, there are not that many games that the code is accesible.`

`This should really be only used for modding for a reference.`
